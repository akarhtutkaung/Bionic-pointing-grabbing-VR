# Project: Bionic pointing-grabbing

#### Descriptions
This project contains the implementation of telekinesis grabbing and storing object. With the telekinesis grabbing, user can select the object from far away then with the movement of the hand controller, the selected object will either come toward the userâ€™s position or get thrown away. To store the objects, user will first need to grab the object that they would like to store and simply move the right-hand controller to the boxes near the left-hand controller.

#### Instructions
###### **Telekinesis grabbing**
1)	Touch the select trigger button on the controller to activate the laser (laser is just a guiding component).
2)	Point the laser to any objects and if the object is grabbable, the laser color will change to Purplish.
3)	Press and hold the select trigger button and move the controller
- *To make the object come toward the user*: Move the controller toward you
- *To make the object thrown away*: Move the controller outward you at the desire direction
4)	The select trigger button must be hold until the object stops in front of the user, once the object halt in front of the user it will start to float (this is to give the sensation of having the telekinesis ability), otherwise, the object will cease to move and just fall onto the ground.

###### **Storing objects**
To store:
1)	Grab the object using right hand controller 
2)	Move the right-hand controller close enough to the box near the left-hand controller (once its close enough, the box will expand)
3)	If expands, release the grab button and it will be stored
Note: Objects cannot be store in the box which another object is already being stored

To take out stored objects:
1)	Move the right-hand controller close enough to the box where the desired object is being stored (once its close enough, the box will expand)
2)	Press the grab button and move the right-hand controller away from the box
3)	The object will come out as the original size as when it was stored
